# Razor Sharp Software Solutions Final Year Project
This is the Github repository for the INFO 3604 undergradute final year project undertaken by Razor Sharp Software Solutions.

## Overview
The University of the West Indies Shuttle Routing and Tracking system (UWI SRTS) is an Android application that was developed by Razor Sharp Software Solutions as fullfilment for their final year project. 

The application tracks the real time location of on duty shuttles commissioned by the University of the West Indies, St. Augustine. 

Students will be able to view the current location of shuttles and their estimated times of arrival to their current location. 

Students will also be able to view the various routes that the shuttles can take. These routes will also have drop off point location information attached to them. These can also be viewed by students. 

Similarly, students will also be able to view alerts relating to the shuttle service that were created by administrators. 

Drivers will also be able to use the application. When they enter the application, they will be able to select their route and shuttle as well as change their on duty status when they are on the job. The application will automatically handle all of the backend work. 

Drivers will be provided with highlighted routes to each drop-off point along their current route from their current location as well as estimated times of arrival to those points.

Lastly, administrators will also be able to use the application. They will be responsible for entering route, drop off point, shuttle, driver and alert information.
